## 👩‍💻 About Me  

Hi, I’m **Ekta Sharma** – a passionate **QA Engineer & Software Tester** who loves ensuring that applications work seamlessly and deliver a great user experience.  

🔹 I specialize in **manual testing, functional testing, and writing structured test cases**.  
🔹 Experienced with **bug tracking tools** like **Jira** and preparing detailed bug reports.  
🔹 Hands-on with **API testing (Postman, Swagger)** and debugging issues across modules.  
🔹 Familiar with **Django + React projects**, template management systems, and admin dashboards.  
🔹 Worked on **OMR Scanning Software (OpticView)**, **Social Media Dashboard**, and other real-time applications.  

💡 My approach: Testing isn’t just about finding bugs—it’s about **thinking like a user, validating like a developer, and ensuring quality at every step**.  

Outside of testing, I explore **automation basics, Python scripting, and open-source contributions** to improve my skills continuously.  

✨ Always curious, always testing, always learning.
